# @syndual/zk

Mocked zk layer for SynDual Protocol. Circom circuits are early prototypes for Dual-State selection and Q-Stream settlement. TypeScript wrappers expose generation/verification stubs.

## Scripts
- `pnpm build` or `pnpm --filter @syndual/zk build`: runs placeholder build script.
- `pnpm test`: currently prints placeholder until real tests are added.

## TODO
- Wire real snarkjs build and verifier generation.
- Add proof key management and trusted setup.
