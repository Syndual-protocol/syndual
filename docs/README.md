# SynDual Protocol Docs

SynDual Protocol blends quantum-inspired dual-state cryptography with zero-knowledge proofs and streaming payments.

## Sections
- Dual-State Cryptography: dual states before finalization.
- Gate-01 Engine: contract logic orchestrating dual-state execution.
- ZK-DualProof (ZKDP): privacy-preserving verification.
- Q-Stream Micropayments: continuous settlement flows.
